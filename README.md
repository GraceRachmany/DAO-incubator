# DAO Incubator

### About

Our purpose is to create more successful DAO pilots, through research, experiments and incubation.

At DAO Incubator we bring together builders, activists, researchers and investors to user in the age of DAOs. We believe the blockchain and decentralised governance space can benefit greatly from a network of physical locations that are conductive to: 

* knowledge transfers
* fostering cross project pollination and conducting integrations
* fundamental and practical research on behalf of DAOs and third parties
* grant applications match-making and support
* funding for incubatees
* prototyping and deploying DAOs for communities as well as traditional institutions and companies

Our model requires us to use cutting edge tools for decentralized governance, funding and task allocation as well establishing a future DAO oriented and managed fund.
