# DAO Crash Test Workshop

**Format:** Online Workshop based on the [CE Ritual Dissent](https://cognitive-edge.com/methods/ritual-dissent/)  
**Participants:** DAO incubator [DAOs](../../dao/) & [mentors](../../mentors.md)

Purpose: test and enhance DAO concepts, mechanics and ideas.

Creators don't like to receive negative feedback, as it demotivates. Experts don't \(usually\) like to share negative feedback or harsh improvements unless they really have to. Sometimes it's easier is to say this is an 'ok' idea than go into an argument. So we focus the workshop on specifically critical feedback and ask somebody to be a receiver instead of the creator himself. Also through several iterations of feedback teams work on testing and improving the concepts accelerating the learning big way. It's also a way to work on your idea with a wide range of great experts from different fields \(tech, econ, legal etc\). 

## Roles

* Concept owner – whoever is core developer of the concept
* Spokesperson – the person who'll be presenting & collecting feedback \(better be not be the concept owner\)
* Mentors – everybody else who'll be helping to improve the idea
* Facilitator – controls time and process compliance

## ToDo's

We identify the 3-5 concept owners who want to improve their concepts. Concept can be anything from the DAO idea, governance mechanic, solution to concrete governance situation. 

1. ~~Before the workshop~~
   1. ~~Announce the event with rules~~
   2. ~~Collect registrations~~
   3. ~~Identifying ideas to present~~ 
   4. Try Zoom for conferencing and breakout rooms
   5. Send all instructions
2. During
   1. Tell instructions and share distribution sheet
   2. Identify facis
   3. Ask/write outcomes from the workshop
3. After
   1. Publish workshop outcomes

## Online Workshop

### 1. Intro & Breakdown

Short wait for connection, welcoming word and overview of the process. Especially focus on the dissent as the requirement.

Concept owners are assigned for separate zoom breakout rooms. All other people are equally distributed across the rooms \(use excel?\).

_Timing: 10 mins_

### 2. Initial pitching in teams, selection of the spokesperson

Concept owner shares the concept.

Each group need to appoint a spokesperson that will pitch this idea. The requirement is for the spokesperson to have “a resilient and robust personality and not bear a grudge”. Better not be the concept owner to be neutral to the idea itself.

_Timing: 5 mins_

### 3. Round of dissent 

The spokespeople need to move to the next room. When your team spokesperson left and another arrived he will present their idea for 3 minutes, at that time a time check will be announced by the facilitator.

If the group are happy to listen for more time they may do so, but from this point onwards the spokesperson can be made to stop or don the mask finished or not. They must present to silence \(the group may not comment or interact with the spokesperson in any way\) and then turn round or don the mask, using the clipboard to take notes on what they hear.

This is how it looks in the regular offline mode. The guy in white shirt \(spokesperson\) pretends he's not there, just writing every bit of feedback
{% endhint %}

The group should then attack the ideas with full and complete vigor \(dissent\) or come up with a better idea or major improvement \(5-7 mins\).

Once complete the spokesperson must not talk with the group but leave to a central area, away from the groups that are working, until all the spokespeople are complete. This is important and addition to the original method. When spokespeople talk with the group they start to explain away the criticism and thereby compromise their learning.

{% hint style="info" %}
Last round in the workshop goes only positive feedback and praising
{% endhint %}

_Timing: 3 mins pitch + 5-7 mins feedback_

### 4. Learning + Improvement

Once all the spokespeople returned they go back to their groups to talk about what they have learnt. They they get ready for the next iteration \(e.g. idea improvements or better wording\) as the cycle can be repeated many times to increase learning, enable multiple perspectives to be taken into account and refine the final outcomes.

{% hint style="info" %}
Workshop consists of 3-5 rounds. Each time to select the the room you go upwards. E.g. if you're in room 3 \(of 5\) spokesperson needs to go to 4. After the round return to 3 for learning. Then on the next go to 5, return back to 3 for learning. Then 1 an so on.
{% endhint %}

_Timing: 5 mins_

### 5. Sharing and Closing

Spokespeople, concept owners \(and anybody else\) can share their funding, closing words.

_Timing: 10 mins_
