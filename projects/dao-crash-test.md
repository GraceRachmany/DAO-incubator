# DAO Crash Test \#1

**Time:** Tue Apr 23, 5pm - 6:30pm CET  
**Format:** Online Workshop based on the [CE Ritual Dissent](https://cognitive-edge.com/methods/ritual-dissent/)  
**Participants:** DAO incubator [DAOs](../dao/) & [mentors](../mentors.md)

Purpose: test and enhance DAO concepts, mechanics and ideas.

Creators don't like to receive negative feedback, as it demotivates. Experts don't \(usually\) like to share negative feedback or harsh improvements unless they really have to. Sometimes it's easier is to say this is an 'ok' idea than go into argument. So we focus a workshop on specifically critical feedback and ask somebody to be a receiver instead of the creator himself. Also through several iteration of feedback teams work on testing and improving the concepts accelerating the learning big way. It's also a way to work on your idea with a wide range of great experts from different fields \(tech, econ, legal etc\).

## Roles

* Concept owner – whoever is core developer of the concept
* Spokesperson – the person who'll be presenting & collecting feedback \(better be not be the concept owner\)
* Mentors – everybody else who'll be helping to improve the idea

## Preliminary

We identify the 3-5 concept owners who want to improve their concepts. Concept can be anything from the DAO idea, governance mechanic, solution to concrete governance situation. 

## Online Workshop

### 1. Intro & Breakdown

Short wait for connection, welcoming word and overview of the process. Especially focus on the dissent side.

Concept owners are assigned for separate zoom breakout rooms. All other people are equally distributed across the rooms \(use excel?\).

_Timing: 10 mins_

### 2. Initial pitching in teams, selection of the spokesperson

Each group is asked to appoint a spokesperson after they have been working for some time. The requirement is for the spokesperson to have “a resilient and robust personality and not bear a grudge”.

Timing: 5 mins

### 3. Round of dissent /assent

Tell the spokespeople to move to the next table in a clockwise/anti-clockwise/diagonal direction and take the vacant seat, but to wait for your instruction before saying or doing anything.

When everyone is sat down repeat the instruction. The spokesperson will present their idea for 3 minutes, at that time a time check will be announced by the facilitator. If the group are happy to listen for more time they may do so, but from this point onwards the spokesperson can be made to turn around or don the mask finished or not. They must present to silence \(the group may not comment or interact with the spokesperson in any way\) and then turn round or don the mask, using the clipboard to take notes on what hey hear. The group should then attack the ideas with full and complete vigor \(dissent\) or come up with a better idea or major improvement \(assent\).

Once complete the spokesperson must not talk with the group but leave to a central area, away from the groups that are working, until all the spokespeople are complete. This is important and addition to the original method. When spokespeople talk with the group they start to explain away the criticism and thereby compromise their learning.

Timing: 3 mins presentation + 7 mins

### 4. Learning + Improvement

Once all the spokespeople are in the central area or if enough time has elapsed, then you send the spokespeople back to their groups to talk about what they have learnt. They they get ready for the next iteration as the cycle can be repeated many times to increase learning, enable multiple perspectives to be taken into account and refine the final outcomes.

Repeat with the next group, last round is always "what's great about" the idea/concept etc.

Timing: 5 mins, repeat step 3 with other team.

### 5. Sharing and Closing

Spokeperson share their funding, closing words.

Timing: 10 mins

4. Send preliminary instructions
5. Use Zoom for conferencing and breakout rooms
6. Allocate faci to each room? \(4-5?\)
