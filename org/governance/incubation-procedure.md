# Incubation procedure

[The poll](https://www.loomio.org/d/XWlsrdyG/incubation-procedure-vote?membership_token=dALM2YcSv2XiLJ6Ai1iaYv9J&utm_campaign=discussion_mailer&utm_medium=email&utm_source=discussion_announced) \(the hyperlinked google doc contains the original language of the procedure.  Items 3, 5a, and 8 have been expanded upon as a result of debate that accompanied the vote, and thus appear longer here than in the original document.\)



1. DAOincubator WG receives an application, does due diligence, chooses \(based on a number of factors that will be defined elsewhere\) to accept the applicant
2. From here, incubation is a 9-15 week process
3. First comes the ideation/ planning phase to formalize an understanding of what the pre-DAO has already and what is required to finalize the demo version of their org.  \(0-1 weeks\). \[**Next step: create a DAOcanvas that we use to evaluate each preDAO’s features and needs \(e.g. their governance model, etc.\)  This may require preDAOs to fill out a second, more specific questionnaire.  This can all be put together on the fly or in advance.**\]
4. Then we start the incubation proper.  Depending on the needs of the project as assessed during the ideation phase, all relevant circles are brought into the process \(this allows for modularity in the way that circles and projects interact: a particular project may require the support of 2 circles, or of all the circles\)
5. The incubation process proper is broken down into 3 stages, with the intensity and complexity of work/subject matter increasing with each subsequent stage, in such a way that we begin with work on the fundamentals and move towards the bells and whistles later in the process.
   1. Because each project is different, these three stages will be defined individually for every pre-DAO. This will be a collaborative process undertaken by project members and their main point of contact within the incubator, i.e. a “mentor” type figure who takes ultimate responsibility for a particular pre-DAO’s progress and experience within the incubator.  \(The three phases will last a total of 8-11 weeks altogether. In many cases, the pre-DAO may not even be aware that there are 3 phases; it will simply help us manage the incubation process by sticking, roughly, to the following format → Stage 1: Cover the basics, Stage 2: Improve and solidify the basics and transform them to reflexes, Stage 3: Last touch and lessons to be learned.\)
6. “Black ops”, which coincides with these three stages, is our opportunity for us to plug DAOincubator-developed tech/in-house projects into the pre-DAO’s we’re incubating.  This allows for mutual testing and advancement.
7. A demo phase follows stage 3, during which we finalize everything and merge the work of every circle into a single project. This should take up to a week, as everyone should be quite familiar with the project by this point.  \(We can conduct a vote, at a later date, on whether we should be under obligation to ensure that a working demo is achieved, or whether we simply commit to providing support and resources.\)
8. The investment phase is for matchmaking — once they have the demo, we’ll open our investor network/matchmaking services to them.  This should last 1-2 weeks \(One way to do this would be to mimic Y-combinator’s demo days: let the pre-DAO teams meet with investors, give presentations, etc., with the goal of getting the right investment from the right investor\) \(**NB: Investments are not necessarily the only type of funding that we’ll be helping our pre-DAOs to obtain.**  There could also be bonding curve-based funding approaches, for example.  Such tokenomics-based funding methods will have to be chosen earlier in the process, \(as early as step 3 and as late as step 5\) but in some cases we can provide guidance on how to navigate these tokenomics-based funding processes during this investment phase.\)
9. Post graduation phase: by keeping in touch with our graduates and playing the role of an alumni association, we can continue to expand our network to reach a wider audience.  At the same time, we’d provide ongoing low-frequency, on-demand mentorship and services.
