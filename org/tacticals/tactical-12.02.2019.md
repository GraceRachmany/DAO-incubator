# Tactical 12.02.2019

### **What is the mission statement?**

More experiments.You can't expect people to just come and fit your biz strategy – DAO Stack, Aragon, nobody does this.  
+ Dgov context = more successful DAO pilots.  
Also getting funding there.

### **How will the DAOincubator be positioned in the ecosystem? \(research lab, do tank, incubator\)** 

DaO Tank. Look at existent opportunities and consulting the projects. Thinking of potential cases \(preIDEA incubation\), like skunkworks.Interesting questions – relations from the protocol. How to not be political, or choose sides?

Being agnostic. Develop practice first, then fund for scaling. Tech choice is somewhere in the end, just before the implementation.  
We also need to build evaluation tools.

### **What is the desired architecture?**

* DAO Leads \(website, comms strategy\) – Max
* Expertise centre – Dani + Adam \(Giveth\) 
* Funding \(+model\) – Cem

Weekly call for coordination

Max will create a closed repo for the incubator, 

For taks management – Trello.

### **Which roles are embedded in the architecture and who are the candidates for the expertise centre?**

* A committed team which produces and formalizes content.
* A communication strategy including a post announcing the launch.
* A well-designed website which provides the mission statement and the ongoing initiatives as well as parties involved.

We can collab on that, Dani can take as a deliverable for next week

### **What is the roadmap?**

1. website: [daoincubator.org](http://daoincubator.org/) \(build on Tilda\) + Cem have some list + include blog – Dani will send access to tilda, Cem will send the list
2. fundraise for some upfront activities
3. EthCC in Paris – aim for the workshop

### How do we organize – DAO or ...

Max: just a volunteering team for now, to be formalized some time before getting funded.  
Cem: lets look at blockcsience  
For the next call – Friday
