## Updates

Theo: EU grants -- GIZ isn't getting involved and DAOinc doesn't hve the track record to get involved at this point in time, but we should stay in touch so we can come on as a contractor later.

Dani: My updates -- I'm getting ready for Malta next week to discuss the legal side of DAOs, doing a workshop with Beth and Wassim, and cohosted this blockchain for science thing where Theo represented DAOincubator a lot, thinking about about becoming a public investment being for DAOs.  I have to do a lot of thinking on that before it's ready to be released, probably in 2-3 weeks.  I also analyzed Moloch and MetaCartel \(who we also had an apiary call with\) 

Pedro: emails are operational.  https coming out today and I'd like to remember we have a free full subscription on gitbook, let's use it folks

Haythem: as an Update, working the last period on experimenting with forking Moloch DAO trying to make a bonding curve with the guildbank instead of using WETH.  the docs and code\(WIP\) is in discord... would love to get ur feedback everyone

* DAO Crash Test \(Max\) – I've announced that the next one will be on May 22nd, I haven't promoted it much and only have 4 registrations so far.  I want at least 15 registrations, otherwise it won't be enough.  

Dani: Phil said someone wants to sponsor us, host us for free in a huge location with food -- decentralized gov't meetings in Paris, and partnering w/ EF who's doing ETHCC in Paris, and maybe we can get a sponsorship for 800/mo that can allow us to do some stuff in Paris or maybe just squirrel the funds away, I hope this deal goes through.

## Max / How we can realize funding and legal needs of DAOs?

Max: We've got several new applications, like audacity, etc. People are mostly asking for legal and funding advice.  Assuming we get some traction and funding ourselves, we should brainstorm how to satisfy those needs.  

Dani: I'd be down to write an article that captures our strategy: we're DAOincubator, we've been around for 3 months, talked to \# DAOs, tested the incubation process with TF... Part 2: we havea  process for incubation: \[Tuna's strategy\].  Part 3: we can be the first GP group in a permissionless alliance, and we'll be connected to a fundraising mechanism and get a cut of the tokens that's yet to be defined.  But we need a complete article \(including our combined experience in advising DAOs before Trojan.\)  We can talk both about investments in this article as well as grants.  

Beth: To help satisfy legal needs -- DO you know about legal design working group, we'll have those calls every Tuesday in may.  Names have been working on ... to translate human readable language into solidity -- i.e. expressing smart contracts in human readable grammar.  There wer supposed to be two elements: a code translations and a legal translation -- what is this DAO's personhood?  Jurisdiciton? etc.?  We'll end up analyzing this smart contract from a legal perspective.  When a DAO platform is being chosen, what legal issues get raised?  THat same mapping can be applied to other DAO platforms, and position us to offer legal analysis as a service.  That's all in the works right now.  Those calls are 6-7pm European time.  

Dani: I'd add that DAOinc should emphasize the legal part because between Beth and others we have globally leading experts on DAO legality.  Silke's phd work is about crypto jurisdiction, etc.  We should also have DAOIncubator business cards.  We could list all these legal workshops on our site.  Getting paid consulting fees in ETH that maybe go to a pool governed by DAOinc.  Reinvesting in the DAO, compensating people, buying plane tickets.  But let's get the deals first and then figure out how to deal with funding we acquire.  

Beth: Legal problems plague a lot of these things in general -- are bonding curves a security? etc.  These questions are raised by a legal audit thing, and it can be super valuable to generate possibilities for content.  I believe Marina's gonna be helping out, and be in malta with us.  

Theo: Q for Beth.  I have a presentation in some days for law school stufents.  If you have any idea what we could ask them to do with us, any research questions etc., how we could onboard people who don't know about governance in DAO terms, I could put out a call to action for them.  

Beth: I do have a lot of questions, one of the main ones being that the idea of translating from common law to normative standards law that ends up being applied to smart contracts.  It's been interesting going from American law school to seeing people practicing more common law here.  It was also requested that we cover: as part of this larger initiative of supporting DAOs, a funding mechanism that enables acting as investors/???, and another that's important in terms of legal consulting, what Pedro says re QAAF \[QAAF - Quality Assurance and Accountability Framework is a must in many economies of scale. DAOs should have somehting like that\]

Adam/Pedro: the DANk --&gt; \[So a couple of things. The basic idea behind the DANk – decentralized accountability network. A group of people who accept the responsibility 8:26 AMMax SemenchukEnsuring proposal accountability – main responsibility of ATF 8:27 AMPedro ParrachiaAccountability as willingness to take responsibility 8:28 AMPedro Parrachiafoster a culture for quality and accountability 8:28 AMMax Semenchukmore informal group with set membership, who will perform that task of keeping the accepted behaviour in the DAO. Pioneering in the Genesis DAO. When there's a proven DANk we can create new DANks\]

Max: Maybe also matching DAOs with potential investors, as in demo days.  

Dani: In a year, doing a DAO demo day at big institutional investors, these are our main offerings, you can invest in these 10 through us.

Beth: Fullnode hosting a DAOinc person allows us to plan investor showcases of whatever kind and demo day type scenarios.  When I refer to accelearotr program for DAOs, this is exactly what I mean -- being able to help not only with knowledge, but specifically understand this is what investors are looking for, these are the concerns they have right now, ... investor interfaces, so at ... we'll get started with that. 

Beth: everyone keeps asking if we have a slide deck

Dani: we need to start making on urgently if we're going to be talking to sponsors, potential investors, etc.  

Theo: Do you guys use google slides?

Beth: yeah

Max: I've heard a request for a slide presentation, should we appoint someone to do it?

Theo: I can share my previous version so we can collaborate on it.  I'm not a graphic designer but I can at least contribute to this process.  

Dani: I also want to do a trello card proposal regarding something I proposed last week -- reward participation in calls and for doing shit.  Dogfood these payment mechanisms.  A planning suite came out on rinkeby, we can use it with test ETH to see hwo a proposed system would work .  We just need to open the DAOinc auturk to rinkeby.  I'll start a DAO oriented towards this and we can start playing with it.  

Pedro: \[rn gendao is the lowest hanging fruit for microgrants we should make use of that 8:33 AMPedro ParrachiaDAO 2 DAO protocols is something we could design and charge them 8:33 AMPedro Parrachiadank too, many other opportunities\]

Dani: Yeah, start iwth the DANk and go from there.  Also we should ask for Rep.  It's always good to give people gov'nce power for contributing work, otherwise you're just extracting surplus value from there.  Gitcoin gives rewards but not a voice, it's just an example of platform capitalism.  Not to call them out in particular, lots of bounties programs have this shortcoming.

Beth: Having rep as a DAO, acting as a DAO in these different ways where we have functional relns w/ other DAOs, get rep on their platforms.

### Dani/ Proposals re:Moloch and joining metacartel's fork

Dani: I took a management consulting/ strategic analysis and broke this down into the good, the bad, the opportunity for us.  DOn't take it as anything but my thoughts: In moloch, if there's a hack of the DAO protocol you cna ragequit, qhich is important based on what happened with TheDAO hack.  Membership process is simple, which is good.  Because you put your money in the pool, if you ragequit without a hack, it has a social cost because you're being an asshole and taking money away from grants.  There's no way to pump and dump ... no share liquidity, shares are not transferable.  This has caused problems for high tributes -some on twitter said it's oligarchy, but it's still a philanthropic venture.  But it also had an effect -- the convo about having EF put block rewards into a DAO that funds research, now Moloch is taking that on, as a DAO that's only open to rich people.  But if we were to virtue signal but joining them, we know there's no expectation of profit because we'd be taking money from grantees.  So it's more for virtue signaling and playing with the DAO architecture.

Meta cartel is very interesting, I Think they'll succeed in what they're doing, not sure it's worth our time to participate.  They'll be launching a DAO that ...  They said only people in the data cartel are able to exploit the user data.  That's what silicon valley did, if you can create data silos in a decentralized environment that's a big thing.  This is the DAO of the meta cartel \( a cartel/network of gas stations that buy when gas is low and sell when high.\)  They trade their services with DApps in exchange for user data.  THey'll make a lot of money by ... It's a smart idea because all cartels have the problem of defection, but because you burn your stake by defecting, it's a smart mechanism economically, but is this what we need as DAOinc?  It's not really virtue signalling to give them funds because there are ethical issues and other problems.  I'ld like to see it be a permissionless data commons that feeds the whole ecosystem.  Maybe we could fuck with a fork of it.  I'd say joining Moloch would be better optics: no expectation of profits, etc.

Liquidity is the most important thing in finance -- for investors to come in and out -- otherwise the liquidity premium means we'd be trading at 80% of a platform that has liquidity.  There should be a mix of Moloch membership proposal + frictions.  We need to be more like a DAO than a permission cartel, w/ bonding curve holders as LPs w/ shared governance via aragon, and subdaos that are GPs, like DAO inc.  So you have a system that has liquidity so people can get profit from thir investment but is open to everyone, not just the rich.  We could virtue signal by contributing to experiments, more like a pure giving thing like Moloch, and we should also talk to meta cartel, not about joining because I don't see the value, but to work collaboratively with them and get some grants from them to have them work with some of our incubatees if everyone agrees on doing so.  

Pedro: funding our DAOs is reason enough joining them 8:50 AMPedro ParrachiaIMO we just need to make sure this is no hidden agenda and we can validate this possibility with them

Dani: They may want to fund DApps not DAOs because the grant is in expecation of user data in return.  If they're interested in funding DAOs we can talk to them about it.

Beth: Is there something we'd have to worry about with optics of sharing our pre-DAOs users' data?  Are our Pre-DAOs bonded to us financially?  In otehr ways? 

Beth: I was thinking of proposing -- there's this specific legal framework analysis/lgel audit for Moloch that we could propose to metacartel as well -- what are the legal concerns, working out a partnership based on advising them on these questions.  From a user standpoint -- what kind of transparency is there?  It could be that the DAOs and their members are interested in getting rewarded for that -- and having Abbey involved can help wit hthe storytelling aspect here -- to say that within the closed environment of the DAOs, we'd be able to bring in more people through helping with this transparency, and if see if there's interest around that.

Theo: blockchain for social good meetup with positive blockchain and GIZ. pat from DAOstack will be there, democracy earth will be there.
