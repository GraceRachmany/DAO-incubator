## **Discord: Let’s please start using it!**

## **Establishing a permanent meeting time: weekends?**

## **Cem / Circles:**

Before each circle can set its own rules about what it’s mandate is and how it should proceed, the circles must get up and running.  Aside from legal, have any other circles been meeting? How should we catalyze this?

We should present the survey in a report format. The first step should be to determine leaderships in the circles. This can also be co-owned/co-led. Then we can assign the role of creating a roadmap for the circle and how it will sync, harmonize, integrate with DAOincubators main roadmap.  


@Expertise circle – can categorize and setup workstreams.

   &gt; Research lead and Conductor role?  


Beth: Mechanism design lead? Didn’t find the opportunity to connect right people together. Design and research are 2 verticals, funding opps can come with that.

Cem: 1 person can coordinate, let’s think who’s the best candidate.

Beth: if you know MIT media lab, we create a design space about workshop for several days for artists. Design sprint for a specific company.  


@faci

Cory: pretty high-level, need to check with people.

Admin call: What is the methodology on determining these roles? \(Consult gitbook guide and survey results.\) We need consensus on what the roles are, on what leadership means.  

## **The respective launch proposals**

DAOstack vs. Aragon vs. colony.  What looks promising about each solution?  What makes one look more attractive than the others?  \(We don’t want to publish one before the others are ready, they should go out simultaneously.\)

## **Ambassadorships**

Any more thoughts on who the ambassadors should be?  What support do they need before they’re ready to reach out to their target organizations?

## **Ongoing testing**

Has anyone been put through the onboarding process?

## **DAOincubator website**
