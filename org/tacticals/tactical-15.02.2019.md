# Tactical 15.02.2019

### Intro round

Beth: work Starfish SF / NY and experimental lab in AI, blockchain etc Experimented with the funding mechanisms. Bunch of different projects want to coordinate in the space. Also dOrg. Human-centric design, expand discussion.

Cori: working on tools for modeling work for gov mechanisms. A lot of research on networks to leverage the existent.

Max: \#dgov community and foundation

Phil: interest in decentralized orgs and social impact. Worked on the Backfeed, now Tribute. Service for distribution of value and power. Want to build it as a DAO.

Adam: started as crypto journalist \(EthNews\), other projects, academic press. Involved in Giveth, that tries to capture the transparency, way to make non-profit more transparent.

James: Greeks received a series of bailout, not a lot of funding/work there. Funding mechs for the art world become side type pool. Create a DAO around token bonding curve, that's an experiment for living wage for artists.

Seth: Working on a project with NFC at the Bushwick generator, where we teach artists to tokenize their work. Either 3d or physical.

### Cem – Makes an overview of what we have now + Wrap up the projects

Info to be published after the call for review.

### Question to all: positioning and expectations from DI

How will the DAOincubator be positioned in the ecosystem?

Adam: founders of most DAOs put all eggs in 1 basket, they want to see it succeed. Having a low-stake environment for experimentation makes sense. In Ethereum space  many projects duplicate the effort. And there's  such danger.

Cem: we're biased, but if we have a free space where everyone can participate, without dogma or scheme.

Adam: from Giveth experience there're merits for dog-fooding, but it sometimes takes in the way. Holding to traditional type of structure can be beneficial.

Dani: some people can specialize. If it takes a form of a traditional bizdev, it can fail. Should be both agile.

Cem: That's why we consider DAO Tank as a name.

Phil: using DAO for the purpose of this project could introduce a bias, right?

Adam: kinda, but DAOs are not proven thus not most efficient. Some people can be resistant for some tools, as they are not in the spirit of decentralization.  It's a great goal and outcome, but can be much harder if we start to use them from day 1.

Cem: it's for learning. Everything we'll be generating knowledge.

Phil: every project can produce the learning experience. I had experience with kanban 15 engineer, board was enough. It was the only way to work. 

Regarding "What is this project" – i'm interested to any. But to reflect to own need/want, i have a project to be shaped as DAO, would be extremely excited to have such a nexus. To have conversation with people who have some knowledge and willing to share it. That's super exciting, and nothing like that around. We all are building tools and publishing articles. But not an active arm for experimenting. So i'd like to contribute/participate.

Cem: that's in line, not much collab happens, protocols are busy building.

Dani: grants are given for infra and apps, but not orgs.

Cem: in lint with experimentation network

James: i think that an environment to encourage sharing and experimenting. between DAOs in various stages of development is something that we need, something that is lacking and what is nessecary to move beyond isolated teams focused on tool development. Hopefully our locally engaged practices on the ground can feed - be funneled into a common pool of learning, where social impact and development tools can cross-inform and grow more organically

Beth: Starfish vision was connected with Berlin/NY/SF, fullnode, buschwick. Ecosystem of spaces. The reason for weekly mech design group. Phase 2 in 2019 – real projects and funding etc. Having a space to experiment, creating things and possible funding. Can plugin very nicely. I've created an infra with the community.

Cem: lot's of synergy with that.

Let's discuss how you can contribute in the chat.
