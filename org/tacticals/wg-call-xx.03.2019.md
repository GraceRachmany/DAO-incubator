## This week's accomplishments

Max: working on something to provide value for incubatees, I call it DAO crash test.  I'll describe the project later.  Had some convos on governance.  It's complicated, so I may just leave it as is.

Dani: workshop and computational law and bc fest in new york.  People from in and out of the space.  Rinkeby aragon dao is almost up and running.  Check if your name is not there so we can start dogfooding trhough that dao.  

pedro: worked on a ton of stuff, mostly in ... the gitbook including a proposal on a framework for decision making, assessment signaling, onboarding assets, code of conduct, offboarding, proposal for a roadmap, something on the site as well.  It's a lot and I think I'll keep myself to the points that I  listed in the tactical meetings.  

James Duncan: I focused on getting this EU grant out this week  and ... refining documentation and roadmap for applying to fundings.  

Beth: had the computational law and blockchain fest, did an open dao workshop

## Max / DAO Crash Test info

I want to share info and get a quick reaction round.  Jordan proposed something based on trojan feedback.  We were unclear what exact value wewanted to provide but it was a good discussion.  We could do this call on a regular basis with DAOinc newcomers.  We haven't followed up but I may like to lead such a project.  I've been thinking about a format called the retail descent??? basically, there are a few teams participating, a few members a piece, and each group has an idea they want to discuss, a concept, a dao,  etc., so they talk to the different groups and discuss strengths and wekanesses with each idea.  There are specific times where a delegate gets negative feedback, then goes through rounds and refines the ideas.  It's a useful technique for fleshing out details.  It's a little complicated to do online but could be useful.  I'll try to do the first project like that in the coming months, try to find someone help me facilitate, it could be a monthly occurrence if possible.  

James: summarize proposal briefly?

Max: I have this idea for a self help group, so anyone interested in doing that  can join the call and share feedback with each other using this game format.  More details to come

Pedro: great experiment, let's do it.

Beth: I want to encourage everyone's ideas, I can't help with it but look forward to checking in when I can

## Adam/ Discussing the regular time for this call

Will this time work for everybody after Europe's time change?

Is everyone cool with bi-monthly, alternating with WG calls?

## Max / Investing in DAOs webinar/panel

## Pedro/ Walk through onboarding / offboarding processes for group to critique

Pedro to lead this part of the discussion

## Adam + Dani / Discuss Aragon voting parameters + do we consider Aragon votes to be "binding"?

If not, can we define a procedure for passing "binding resolutions"?

## Adam / Joining and leaving circles + documenting membership: define a procedure

Theo and Jordan want to leave the community circle due to bandwidth restraints.  Should each circle have its own processes spelled out for bringing on members, tracking current members, and losing members? Or is this something want to define across all of DAOincubator?

## Adam/ Should communities circle or communications lead be in charge of social media?

There is some ambiguity around this in our documentation

Is a media strategy a valuable thing to have right now? If not, at what point will it be?

## Adam + Pedro / What are our short/medium term priorities?\*\*

Proposed priorities:

1 decision making - Loomio, Aragon, Gitbook...

2 onboarding - Daniel and Cem's candidates

3 roadmap - to wrap up what has been done so far and what's in front of us X our goals and objectives

## End of meeting: Announcements

### Adam/ Pedro: Mention: sprint on website
