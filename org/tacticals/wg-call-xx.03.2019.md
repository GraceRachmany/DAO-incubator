## Finding a regular time for this call



## Beth's logo designer connection \(Yiying Lu\)

## Walk through onboarding/ offboarding processes for group to critique

## Discuss Aragon voting parameters + do we consider Aragon votes to be "binding"?

If not, can we define a procedure for passing "binding resolutions"?
