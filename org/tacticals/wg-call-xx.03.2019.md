If not, can we define a procedure for passing "binding resolutions"?

## Adam / Joining and leaving circles + documenting membership: define a procedure

Theo and Jordan want to leave the community circle due to bandwidth restraints.  Should each circle have its own processes spelled out for bringing on members, tracking current members, and losing members? Or is this something want to define across all of DAOincubator?

## Adam/ Should communities circle or communications lead be in charge of social media?

There is some ambiguity around this in our documentation

Is a media strategy a valuable thing to have right now? If not, at what point will it be?
