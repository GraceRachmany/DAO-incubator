# WG Call 08.04.2019

Lily intro – designer and friend of CEM

Project updates

Website & Logo \(Cem\) – ?

* DAO Crash Test \(Max\) – 14 signups, attracting the facis, probably 23rd, we're trying to attract two or three professional facilitators like Pheobe or Francesco from DAOstack.

## Adam/ Resort the order of discussion points

Meeting format: names indicate who will lead that section of the discussion. At 10 minutes to the end of the call, we'll skip from wherever we are to the asterisked agenda item\*\* for a lightning round

Add announcements and discussion points that are not listed, and rearrange the order of topics in case anyone is worried about an important topic getting missed because it's too low in the agenda

## Adam / What are our main goals as an org?  Which circles are dedicated to achieving those goals?

Can we define a hierarchy of goals in terms of a timeline? Where do we want to be in a month, 6 months, a year?

* Max: really help at least 1 DAO \(Trojan?\)
* Theo: getting the experience from launching DAOs. Get takeaways, even by observing. In a year – look at all examples and find patterns and best practices on how to launch DAOs. Figure out what is actually a DAO and informing people on it and approaches to use.
* Adam: real life experience, funding channel, coordination 
* Cem: will post the objectives, can crowd-create those \(trello card + google doc\)

## Max / How can the communications strategy be tailored to support our goals, now and later?

* Max: attract more DAO practitioners, share our learnings
* Theo: we can address it to Jack Laing, as he has experience with communications

## Beth/ Dani: takeaways from sharing DAOincubator with people outside the organization

2 workshops done, 1 coming in Amster.

Adam: please share the outcomes in the chat

## Adam / last week Beth mentioned bringing on part time "advisors" like her friend the logo designer.  Is this something that circle leads can take charge of?

Or should we have a formalized process for taking on advisors? Perhaps based on the working group onboarding process but less rigorous?

Cem also made a trello card for creating a list of all current advisors

Beth: is it's a part time contract or just and advisor for specific project. There're some people that are excited. I was working on filling out advisors. 

Adam: I use the term 'advisor' loosely, maybe we need different levels of contacts. How we keep track of all advisors. Making a list can be useful.

## James S / Communitism workshops

James: Started to do workshops with Cem to experiment on various crypto primitives. Teams of artists are working together. To engage the community and do this through practice.

Adam: Communitism – is existent space in Athens, before Trojan. James got them really excited about Trojan and further events.

James: can send the program which we work on [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eykrBCvtFuKuAQYZH3BejVDdnmhDNZVyHyLa93Cj\_aI/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eykrBCvtFuKuAQYZH3BejVDdnmhDNZVyHyLa93Cj_aI/edit?usp=sharing)

Adam: this is a way to engage the artists in Trojan, so they think about tech, crypto primitives etc.

James: There's a trello card in the Trojan DAO trello.

## PhilH / Who manages discord and further issues with it

Phil: permissions are fixed, core group have rights to add/set permissions for people.

## Announcements

### Adam / Monthly DAOincubator reports

Great basis for communications materials. Every circle lead and major role at DAOinc should contribute on a monthly basis.

### Cem / New trello card for defining the orientation milestones/ procedure

i.e. all the steps someone must go through to be appropriately up to speed

### Theo or James D / Grants and Funding update

Theo: James submitted the letter of interest for the EU $1M grant \(EU Commission\). Next step is the actual application till September with detailed list of incubatees.

Adam: Trojan also applied there, we should see if it makes sense to apply together.

Cem: becoming a fun is a problem? are they ok?

Lili: can check the application for you, managed the EU fund before

Theo: Awesome. @DAO Stack – Pedro has wrapped up a proposal. Need to clarify: 1\) how do we deal with ambassadors to initiate relations 2\) how we distribute the fund and make it transparent.

Cem: can you create a task

Theo: +
