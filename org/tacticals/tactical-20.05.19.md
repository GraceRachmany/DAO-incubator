### Adam / Call for more devs to join the Trojan Foundation

## Discussion

### Pedro + Beth + Adam / Limited short term funding solutions

We're working on some genDAO proposals that will, at least one of them, the DAO2DAO and maybe more, bring in some small but concrete funding to DAOincubator.  \(Describe DAO2DAO for people on call.\)  This raises a couple of points:

A\) We are actively pursuing projects that are likely to bring in near term funding and believe it's crucial that more work like this be done.  Practice fierce care as an organizational principle and adapt collective strategies for stewarding DAOincubator.  This is an important component of our vision for the way to run the DAOincubator at this stage.

B\) With short term funding, we could establish a "keep the lights on" fund to cover domain expenses, etc.

C\) Speculation with some of these funds could be part of a larger fierce care strategy.

### Adam / Tuna's procedure proposal passed. It's time to pilot it

What roles will be required for a minimum viable pilot?
