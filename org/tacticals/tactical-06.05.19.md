## Adam/ Resort the order of discussion points

Meeting format: names indicate who will lead that section of the discussion. At 10 minutes to the end of the call, we'll skip from wherever we are to the asterisked agenda item\*\* for a lightning round

### Adam / Add announcements and discussion points

that are not listed, and rearrange the order of topics in case anyone is worried about an important topic getting missed because it's too low in the agenda

## Discussion

### Theo / EC Grant

### Roles, their descriptions and how they get assigned

What gaps exist in the current roles?  Can we get a process for filling them once they're identified?

Some circles don't have a leader, so it's hard to track who's responsible for what.

### Pedro / Others Grants and funding sources

We have a reasonable amount of grant/microgrant opportunities that we're missing.  Not only organizational but also personal, artistic, etc.  We've already assessed that legal and funding are the things needed most urgently at the moment.  Also, we need a funding circle, as we've ID'd funding as a priority.

### Adam / The website: how are we going to knock this out?

A good case study for a tangible deliverable that's struggling.  How can we do better, here and in other goals we've set for ourselves?  Is the problem a lack of role definition?  A lack of engagement?

### Cem's idea: a ledger for accounting the work we've been doing \(to eventually get paid for work we've done, and to keep track of what's going on\)

The trello was a great step forward, but we can dogfood something more advanced



## Announcement

### Tuna's survey
