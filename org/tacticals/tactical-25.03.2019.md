## Announcements

* Cem: we get a lot of attention. We lack a clear org structure, model – we need to focus on that

## Pedro / Validating the onboarding proposals

Cem started a broad doc, a I updated it and submitted on Loomio. Let's test it. We can choose someone and implement it. There're some gaps.

Who want's do add another person?

no.

Cem: let's proactively invite.

The invitation has been done.

## Max / DAO Incubator Model

Project gives x% tokens, consultant get project tokens/DAO incubator tokens.

**Is it applicable? Ways to improve it.**

**Cem:** nice question, thinking about it. Find useful the biz model doc from Magicians. Can be mulitple models. E.g. monetization from enterprise clients. But be cautious. Maybe more altruistic / grant based. Maybe get directly paid from incubatees. Put all proposals in Trello. Starting with grant seems like a good start with buffer period.

**Pedro:** important to have queu cards. Sounds like a nice default option. Create a trello task fro that for options.

**Cory:** i like from biz perspective, but not sure what to do with tokens, too complex. Instead find the orgs that are using token models, without committing funds to it.

**Theo:** Agree with Cem, token is experimental, keep in sandbox environment. Regarding biz model, based on grants. Some biz models can be not fit, let's look into social good model.

Decision: First bunch of incubatees are incubated for free, expenses are covered by grants. Can be paying clients \(not incubatees\).

## Cem / Blocking Anonymous jitser

Cem: we can switch to the other tool. Also asking names

Max: can try Zoom

## Max / Who’s responsible for the service part?

Cem: circles are made. There were questions around the governance. There is a higher layer council, that facilitates. Out of research, admin and etc, where the prioritization happens. Can call it delivery, cause service can be understood as transactional. We need very clear determination – who will look into each project, and break it down into tasks, allocate tasks and keep in check assignment and delivery schedule \(Maestro position\). On Pedros comment ESA is interesting – would like to look into it, maybe you can share. Skeptical on delivery of clear processes, super smart, but will try no tot become the exactly same thing. They have produced significant rhetoric.

Pedro: based on ESA, instead of core team switch to launch teams. Different nodes, in the end there's ESA economic space. Maybe we can have a self incubation circle.

Cory: can't say on rings services, e.g. legal can have specific deliverables \(e.g. entity, pitfall identification\), devs have also deliverables \(code, feature etc\). Don't know to much about ESA, but having requirements to each circle may have some sense.

Theo: it's important to have this process, we need to document what exactly we did with existent projects to repeat that.

## Cem / Governance Process?
