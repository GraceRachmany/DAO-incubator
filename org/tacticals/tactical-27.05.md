## Discussion

### Max / Should we focus on internal ideas first in the incubator?

* Dani: Both 
* Adam: shouldn't be externally focused. Don't want to focus more on internal. Don't want to loose momentum
* Beth: doing lots of stuff. Trojan, Starfish, SubTrojan
* Haythem: are we internal or external?
* Pedro: we should continuously make temperature checks and focus on people \(who is DAO incubator\). Fierce care

### Max / DAO incubator commitment from mentors \(e.g. 2 hours / month\)

* Max yes, 2 hours per months or more for free
* Adam: providing help already, won't be a problem. Not sure a time based commitment is the right thing. Maybe having a lead mentor, that can invest more hours. Maybe others can spend minutes on answering legal question
* Pedro: commitment can be too strong, but having good processes and social contract
* Beth: we're already doing some
* Dani: would love to see that translating into reputation
* Phil: providing limited unpaid work is fine. It seems that it should be compensated after the experimental phase. Don't know the level of service. Assuming that service is substancial – should be compensated. Think about how DAO inc should be paid. How are we paid by external DAOs – tokens, crypto or else.
* Theo: we should keep an eye on the conflict of interests. We have people working for companies like Aragon. That can translate in the inequalities in the future.

### Max / What should DAOincubator achieve in 2019 so I'd be proud of it

* Max: help 10 DAOs
* Dani: funding and legal structure is understood, Vitalik and Lublin to put 1000 ETH each in the Incubator
* Beth: taking a few DAOs through ideation process, having reports and metrics on DAO performance, contribute to advancements like bonding curves. Presence at DappCon
* Adam: 2-3 DAOs went through the process and go mainnet with users
* Pedro: DAO inc becomes a minimum viable organization.

### Dani / List of DAOincubator achievements

Dani would like to make a live poll listing 3 personal or collective achievements that people believe were made at DAO Incubator. Make a tweet, pic or else. 

* Dani: happy about the legal working group, DAO Crash Test, DAOcon presence. 10 ppl, 20 ppl etc
* Beth: DAO workshops at festival, new legal people in the circle, how many DAOs are interested, talking with ecosystem. Great stuff with Trojan DAO. Advised for Curacao.
* Anja: would be DAO event in Port of Spain \(new DAO in Caribbean\)
* Pedro: early stage self incubation, how we operate internally
* Max: polished a bit 4 DAO/tech ideas, engaged 12 DAOs to apply, great experts in the group

### Pedro / Testing Tuna's incubation procedure before the Starfish "dry run"

Thinking in terms of software development, this procedure's approval marks a deployment from dev environment \(Tuna's miro board\) to testing environment \(rehearsal, simulation, other types of testing\) . then staging \(starfish\), to finally production \(external DAO\). 

So the may diference between testing and staging is the fidelity to IRL conditions. testing is something done still in the workshop while staging tries to emulate the same conditions from the production environment/real world.

Pedro: Agreed on the next steps – want to propose a step in between. Check the work structure / skills to prepare for the start. Was referencing to the tech / testing environment and then deploy to the staging. Starfish – real DAO, close friend. Take the procedure as a metaphor. Maybe with the DAO Crash Course.

Beth: We did a 6 hour crash test and discussed with the cofounders.

Adam: Maybe we can revisit the results of that session? We'll coordinate that of the call.

### Pedro \(Adam as a backup\) / DAOincubator reboot

Maybe it's time to try different approaches. I suggest that, for starters, we pick a clean slate for a few areas:

* PR \(website, branding\)
* project management \(kanban\)
* funding \(strategy, plan\)
* Org structure \(from circles to cells\)

We have duos, trios etc, working in smaller cells. Hoping to write down clear proposals, suggestions etc. Would be even better if we do work together.

* Max: do a strategic session, next big opp offline may be at Web3
* Adam: strategic session sounds cool, can start with calls as it can be hard to find everybody offline. Regardless of circles people work with their peers. In terms of funding – major problem. Micro grants  is the strategy we're pursuing with Pedro.
* Dani: short term microgrants are ok, more funds in the long run
* Duncy: we have an appreciation of DAOs, we can setup the reputation and then start the consulting work
* Phil: spending few hours a month to talk about the strategic things will harm real operations. Having a real life session seems like a good idea. Would be a totally different thing to have a 1-2 days session and go on with the work after that.
* Theo: agree. Lots of questions for funding come out of the who we are and what we do, how are we governed. Would help setting operations. Evidence shows that physical presence / kickoff improves the chances to survive. Maybe we can organize it around the blockchain week.

### Adam / Strategic Session

Can someone take lead on those before we make a strategic session? Pls do so.

* PR \(website, branding\)
* project management \(kanban\)
* funding \(strategy, plan\)
* Org structure \(from circles to cells\)

### Max / Questions from the DAOs \(xls\)

### Max / Web 3 presence

Dgov is organizing the Node at web 3 – can use this opp.
