###  Pedro / Testing Tuna's incubation procedure before the Starfish "dry run"

Thinking in terms of software development, this procedure's approval marks a deployment from dev environment \(Tuna's miro board\) to testing environment \(rehearsal, simulation, other types of testing\) . then staging \(starfish\), to finally production \(external DAO\)...  so the may diference between testing and staging is the fidelity to IRL conditions. testing is something done still in the workshop while staging tries to emulate the same conditions from the production environment/real world

### Max / Focus on internal ideas first in the incubator

### Max / DAO incubator commitment from mentors

### Max / What should DAOinc achieve in 2019 so I'd be proud of it

### Pedro \(Adam as a backup\) / DAOincubator reboot

Pedro wants to clean up trello and Pedro take over as funding circle lead -- he's already taken initiative by helping to cut costs and  pursuing multiple microgrants on genDAO.  He's testing the Notion.so app \(a freemium version of quip\)

Others have led the circle until now, and now Pedro has the momentum to be effective in that role.  In the future, someone could co lead or take the mantle from him.
