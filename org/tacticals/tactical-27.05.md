## Max / Focus on internal ideas first in the incubator

## Max / DAO incubator commitment from mentors



## Adam and Pedro / Testing Tuna's incubation procedure before the Starfish "dry run"

Thinking in terms of software development, this procedure's approval marks a deployment from dev environment \(Tuna's miro board\) to testing environment \(rehearsal, simulation, other types of testing\) . then staging \(starfish\), to finally production \(external DAO\)...  so the may diference between testing and staging is the fidelity to IRL conditions. testing is something done still in the workshop while staging tries to emulate the same conditions from the production environment/real world

## Pedro \(Adam as a backup\) / DAOincubator reboot

cleaning up trello board, Pedro take over funding circle lead -- he's been cutting costs already and is pursing multiple microgrants on genDAO, has already taken the initiative.  Also testing the Notion.so app \(a freemium version of quip\)

Others have led the circle until now, and now Pedro has the momentum.  In the future, someone could co lead or take the mantle from him.
