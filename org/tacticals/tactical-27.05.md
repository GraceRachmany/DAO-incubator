## Announcements



## Discussion

### Max / Focus on internal ideas first in the incubator

### Max / DAO incubator commitment from mentors

### Max / What should DAOincubator achieve in 2019 so I'd be proud of it

### Dani / List of DAOincubator achievements

Dani would like to make a live poll listing 3 personal or collective achievements that people believe were made at DAO Incubator.

### Pedro / Testing Tuna's incubation procedure before the Starfish "dry run"

Thinking in terms of software development, this procedure's approval marks a deployment from dev environment \(Tuna's miro board\) to testing environment \(rehearsal, simulation, other types of testing\) . then staging \(starfish\), to finally production \(external DAO\). 

So the may diference between testing and staging is the fidelity to IRL conditions. testing is something done still in the workshop while staging tries to emulate the same conditions from the production environment/real world

### Pedro \(Adam as a backup\) / DAOincubator reboot

Maybe it's time to try different approaches. I suggest that, for starters, we pick a clean slate for a few areas:

* PR \(website, branding\)
* project management \(kanban\)
* funding \(strategy, plan\)
* Org structure \(from circles to cells\)

### Max / Questions from the DAOs \(xls\)
