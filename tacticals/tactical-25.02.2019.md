## Announcements

### Cem / how we invite additional people

You need to suggest a person before the invitation and let know Cem, so he can manage the tree.

### Cem / school of disobedience

School of anarchists, thoughts about UBI, crypto, where to push formalization, mute negative effects of markets. There's interest from art and activist fields. Receptive to new forms of governance and critical lens towards society. Expect further news over there.

Beth was talking about that as well, curious who Cem've talked to.

Cem: organized by Erik Bordello \(sorry if misspelled\), economist and much more, the Sphere \(circus group to be organized as DAO and protect IP\). Would be nice to org something with him.

### Dani / post about the design

Created an Aragon DAO for grants, maybe also an Estonian company. We're looking towards funding to build the sustainable operations. The question is who will fund it, long term strategy, reputation mechanics. Will share the article and we can discuss.
