## Announcements

### Cem / how we invite additional people

You need to suggest a person before the invitation and let know Cem, so he can manage the tree.

### Cem / school of disobedience

School of anarchists, thoughts about UBI, crypto, where to push formalization, mute negative effects of markets. There's interest from art and activist fields. Receptive to new forms of governance and critical lens towards society. Expect further news over there.

Beth was talking about that as well, curious who Cem've talked to.

Cem: organized by Erik Bordello \(sorry if misspelled\), economist and much more, the Sphere \(circus group to be organized as DAO and protect IP\). Would be nice to org something with him.

### Dani / post about the design

Created an Aragon DAO for grants, maybe also an Estonian company. We're looking towards funding to build the sustainable operations. The question is who will fund it, long term strategy, reputation mechanics. Will share the article and we can discuss.

## Cem / Roadmap

* formation of an organizational architecture with filled roles 
* establishing relationships with the ecosystem
* launch research initiatives & start publishing
* start DAOincubator PoC

Pedro: let's recognize a preparational stage and don't keep strong attachments.

Cem: yeap

Dani: same for roles

@crosspollination – everybody can propose a project.

## Cem / Trojan workshop

[Description draft](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YkHNCJEoTeZH_jx0S5rlM7Fppld7wUCbHH6Mf8qM-jA/edit?usp=sharing)

Goals:

* advancing the Trojan vision and implementation
* start organically developing a process for the DAOincubator
* start to crystallize the roles in our community

Tools / Primitives:

* Bonding curves

Cory: are you using an NFT? 

Adam: No. Using Trojan token, for tickets and other things, converted to Eth.

Cory: you can provide liquidity by limiting the amount of reserve. We need a secondary market for people who want to liquidate. Front running is also a challenge. Creating a token that is worth something and you can actually liquidate. Plus a lot of such system tie token to governance. It's with debating whether it should be used.

Adam: for certain projects, like sculpture, it can be purchasable only by Trojan token.
