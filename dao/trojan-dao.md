# Trojan DAO

**Purpose:** The TrojanDAO will manage a Community Fund. Trojan Foundation members can vote on how to spend this money: issuing of bounties and, mostly, grants to support art projects. Smart contracts will enable participating projects to manage funding, income distribution, and project governance rights. The goal is to use art value chains to feed a self-sustaining, democratically governed ecosystem for the remuneration of creative labor as a commons.

**Current Stage:** Reseach

## Governed Objects & Mechanics

Fund distribution by community voting. Enable participants to coordinate and manage budgets for cultural production through smart contracts while lowering bureaucratic costs.

## Looking for

Development expertise, Legal advice, advice on funding/grants.
